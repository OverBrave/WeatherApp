# WeatherApp

This is my first Flutter project that I developed with Backend.
Django is used in the background of this simple and easy to use Weather app.

## Installation

1. Create a new Flutter project:
```
flutter create weather_app
```

2. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/OverBrave/WeatherApp.git
```

3. Test your changes by running the app on an emulator or a physical device:
```
flutter run
```

## Packages

- [hive](https://pub.dev/packages/google_nav_bar) - Save for user selected city in device storage.
- [provider](https://pub.dev/packages/provider) - It provides a state management technique that is used for managing a piece of data around the app.
